These are the source codes for the project of iam 557, in this readme the files are briefly explained.
main.py:
    main has the standard operations, the functions are mostly used to generate results, and running part does the
    operation for all methods, which may take time, so a user is recommended to read the script part first.

project:
    project is the module with the classes and functions used, init only establishes import routines
    BestSubsets: The class to compute best subset selection
    ConfusionMatrix: Class that computes the confusion matrix for classification and yields various information about it
    DataLoader: The classes to load data, base class is for generic data loading and classification is mostly used as a fast way to access parts of the data useful for classification.
    functions: The functions that does not have a class associated are stored here
    ModelInterface: The classes are to simplify the usage of sklearn models
    PredictionData: This is a data class that can move around easily between functions

results:
    this folder can be a handful, but results are presented in two ways:
    plots:
        maps are the matrix maps for various operations
        co_ are the regular dataset subset search plots
        lrk_ are the linear regression killed subset search plots
    texts:
        results: the subset selection results from various operations
        times: the time recordings of operations

datas:
    along with the dataset used for the project, in this folder there are some additional data that was used for testing

venv libary root:
    This is the folder for the virtual environment. It was generated by pycharm and it can be used as the interpreter, if this is not wanted it can safely be ignored

dependencies:
    python 3.9.1 (may or may not work for earlier distributions, it probably will for 3.6+), numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, pandas
